**About the Project**

This project uses data science to most accurately predict if
a couple will get divorced or not based on a 54 question
survey. We used Principle Component Analysis to reduce 
the dimensionality of the data set so that we could visualize
the results and used a Support Vector Machine to linearly
separate the divorced statistics from the not divorced ones.
Our results indicate that this survey is a very good 
indicator of whether you will be divorced or not, with a
accuracy percentage of 98.1%.
